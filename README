Completion is a parser construction kit, written in Javascript.

It is currently non-functional and in development.

Parsers created with Completion are able to return possible completions to text parsed.

This has required a few (possibly new) concepts, such as the 'matched' state of a parser being orthogonal to its 'closed' state.
